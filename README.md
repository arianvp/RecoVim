RecoVim
=======

A cross-platform, scriptable speech recognizer, originally created for doing vim editting


Why
===

After reading the post about VimSpeak on hacker news (https://github.com/AshleyF/VimSpeak?source=cc) I though I'd write a cross-platform version.

Usage
=====

Fork and open in eclipse. from there you can run it!

Grammar
=======

The grammar files are http://www.w3.org/TR/jsgf/ format, which scripts in the Tags. The scripts are written in javascript.  (See source for examples)



TODO
====

At this point I only have a simple "normal mode" grammar, and a basic switching system, to switch between grammars (see normal_mode.gram).
